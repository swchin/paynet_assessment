jupyter_code.ipynb: jupyter notebook for the whole code, ingestion, cleaning, transformation and visualisations are included inside.

clustering.ipynb: This notebook explores customer clustering to uncover behavioral patterns and identify actionable opportunities for personalized strategies and business growth.
*Notes: Just a preliminary ML modelling, it looks like KMeans is not very satisfactory, we can use HDBSCAN for outliers, then GMM on the core populations for a better result.

jupyter_code.html: html version of the code
